            <p> The second assignment was to make a so called "How to" video.
                </p> 
            <p> Here, I acquired knowledge about techincal terms, video genres and compositions, and also learned basic editing, animation and color grading in Adobe Premiere and After Effects.
            </p> 
            <p>Our job was to come up with an idea that shows an action process. It was hard to agree on one topic, but in the end we
                chose to make a video on "How to frame a picture", which is kind
                of a play of words.</p>

                What I did
            </h2>
            <div class="whatidid">
                <p>As soon as we decided on the idea, we started shooting. The idea with the title "How to frame a picture" was that we are also framing the picture for murder.  </p>
                <p>We decided to make the video in a stop motion style. Our group gathered when everyone was free and we cut out paper parts that we would use for the video and assembled them.</p>
                <p>I was operating the camera, and managing the flow of the project. I also edited some parts together and did the outro image.</p>

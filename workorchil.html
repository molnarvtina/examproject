            <p> This assignment consisted of two parts. In the 
                first part our job was to come up with a business idea while following the business model canvas. In the second part we focused on branding,social media and content.creation. </p> 
            <p> This project was also an enterprenur competition, where my team got 19th place out of the 80 groups. </p> 
            <p>I think I learned the most during this period in my first semester. I learned more about HTML, CSS and using Adobe XD. I also gained more 
                knowledge on project management, branding and social media. </p>

                <p>In this project, I had the role of projectmanager. My job was to create a plan,and assign everyone with a role or task.</p>
                <p>After creating the schedule, we held meetings according to our plan, to discuss what our product should be. We decided on office supplies that has orchid seeds integrated in them. I did research about  our competitors and possible partners - that
                helped us shape a better picture of how we can achieve what we aimed for, and what other strategies we should use, what our budget should be, etc.</p>
                <p>Based on the mockup one of the group members made, I coded the prototype website. 
                </p>
                <p>In the second part of the project we changed a lot of things. Our decision was to completely rebrand what we did in the first half of the project, because we felt like we didn't communicate our product correctly. After that I created the new mockups for phone devices, and then coded my assigned page.</p>
                <p>We also made a content plan for social media sites, and created
                    promotional, educational or fun content based on the plan.
                    </p>

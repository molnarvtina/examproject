            <p> This is the second part of one of my assignments. You can find the first part <a href="./dancedance.html">here.</a></p> 
            <p>The point of the assignment was to overtake another groups work, and make it responsive (using HTML and CSS) for both phone and computer devices. We got the Bollywood dance style.</p> 
            <p>Eventhough the task was to make the pages responsive, we were given creative freedom, and were allowed to change anything, if we had a reason and a valid argument.</p>

                <p>My job here was simple: to make my assigned page responsive. I got the page for the instructors.</p>
                <p>We focused more on rebranding the whole dance studio, and redoing the whole layout of the website. The instructor page previously was just the picture of the teachers listed under eachother, and a long description of them. I chose to put it into a 2x2 grid, that becomes a column if the resolution wisth is less then 768 pixels.</p>
                <p>We did some research and decided to change the layout of the whole website and the colors as well, so it connects more to the culture of the dance style.</p>

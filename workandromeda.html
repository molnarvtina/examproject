            <p> Our first assignment was to code a website from scratch.</p> 
            <p> In this Group project, each of us had to code a semantically correct page with relevant content and images, and also had to create an edited image in Photoshop.</p> 
            <p>During this period I was introduced to Photoshop, HTML and CSS.</p>

                What I did
            </h2>
            <div class="whatidid">
                <p>First of all, I created some sketches based on how I would want the website to  look like and gathered ideas about what the photoshopped picture should be. </p>
                <p>After the brainstorming, we all met and shared our ideas, then collectively agreed on the idea and the style everyone liked. </p>
                <p>We started coding our pages individually. I edited the picture in Photoshop. Our website was about a facility in space, so I decided to edit a picture of a bar, that has a view on space. I altered a picture of the moon in space, cut out the cafeteria windows and inserted my picture of space

            <p> This assignment consists of two parts. The first part of the project was to code a semantically correct website for phone, and the <a href="./workbolygge.html">second part</a> was to make someone else's website responsive. </p> 
            <p> Each group in my class was assigned with one dance stlye, and we all had tocreate a website for a dance school, that teaches that certain dance. Our group got contemporary dance.</p> 
            <p>While working on this project I learned more about HTML and CSS, target groups, design principles, and Adobe XD</p>

                <p> Our first meeting was about just scheduling and laying out what each group member should do in this project.</p>
                <p>On our second meeting we did research, decided on our target groupand our image. My job here was to interview some people, and gather some information about how people feel about this particular dance.</p>
                <p>We laid out some rules about how the website should look, so even if we code our pages seperately,the website itself will look coherent. After that, I made the mockup for the page. I shared it with my groupmates, and after approval I coded it. I also wrote content appropiate text for my page and my groupmates pages.</p>
